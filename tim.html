 <p>The mastermind behind this mediocre website.</p>
 <p>I am a strategic visual designer. I’m passionate about producing memorable solutions in digital experiences, design systems, and brand identity.</p>
<hr class="two">
 <p style="color:#00BA6E;">A LITTLE BACKGROUND</p>
 <h4>ABOUT ME</h4>
<p>I was born in Vietnam and moved to Colorado in 2003 with my parents and grandfather as first-generation immigrants. I grew up in Denver where I would discover the beauty of Colorado — from a web browser as I never got out that much. My parents are super chill and kinda just like to watch movies and garden after work, which they for sure passed on to me.</p>
<p>I attend the University of Colorado at Boulder studying Strategic Communication with an emphasis on Media Design and minoring in Creative Technology and Design. Being in Boulder, I try to get out a little more but still spend a lot of time indoors with my laptop working on designs and interfaces.</p>
<p>I enjoy learning about the industry, whether that be from reading human interface guidelines to following industry leaders on Twitter. My work ranges to accommodate the change that the design world experiences. I believe that every adjacency is an area to explore. Don’t be narrow and secure, be an expert in one field but learn how to appreciate other areas. My designs are a reflection of that.</p>

 <p style="color:#00BA6E;">HOW ABOUT SOME</p>
 <h4>COFFEE?</h4>
 <p>Are you a recruiter looking for a “tech wiz” (voted for by my high school), a designer looking for a collaborator, or just a stranger looking to be friends? No matter who you are* I would love to connect over some coffee, virtual or real. *no murderers</p>
